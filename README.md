# In-Memory Todo App

Implementation of In Memory Todo App to demostrate working of `React.js` with a `Node.js - Express.js` backend.

We are not using any database so all the data persists only till the server is up, once the server restarts all the data shall be dumped.

# How to setup & run locally

```
git clone https://github.com/Ankitcode99/In-Memory-Todo-App-Backend.git
cd In-Memory-Todo-App-Backend
npm install 
npm run dev
```
